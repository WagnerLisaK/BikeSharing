# Bike Sharing

## Overview of Analysis
Bike-sharing is very successful in New York City.  This project was to analyze NYC data to help determine whether a similar bike-sharing program would be successful in Des Moines Iowa.  Although, Des Moines' population is much lower than NYC, NYC has a large data set and a similar climate, so the data could easily be "sized-down" to match Des Moines' population.  The data analyzed is for the month of August.

## Results

August provides a very large data set of 2.3 million rides.  The average trip duration is pretty consistent at just under 1000 seconds (about 15 minutes).  Overall, most of the riders are male, with over 1.5 million rides, followed by females with almost 600,000 rides.  The rides start and end in the same part of the city.

As shown below, trip duration is about the same no matter the gender and most rides occur on Thursdays and Fridays with still a good number of rides on the rest of the days of the week.

## Summary
Based on the analysis, having a bike-sharing program in Des Moines seems feasible.  Some more research needs to be done on the maintenance of bikes and why the bikes with the highest bikeIds are the most used.  Should the bikes be "rotated" to spread out the wear and tear?  How many bikes would be needed for the population of Des Moines if the number was based on population of expected riders?  Also, the majority of riders appear to be subscribers - Why is that??
